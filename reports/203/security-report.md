## 🕷️ OWASP ZAP Findings

### Application Error Disclosure

- **Severity:** Low
- **URL:** `https://stg-app.bosta.co/api/v2/pickups`
- **Description:** This page contains an error/warning message that may disclose sensitive information like the location of the file that produced the unhandled exception. This information can be used to launch further attacks against the web application. The alert could be a false positive if the error message is found inside a documentation page.
- **Solution:** Review the source code of this page. Implement custom error pages. Consider implementing a mechanism to provide a unique error reference/identifier to the client (browser) while logging the details on the server side and not exposing them to the user.

---

### Cross-Domain Misconfiguration

- **Severity:** Medium
- **URL:** `https://stg-app.bosta.co/api/v2/pickups`
- **Description:** Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server.
- **Solution:** Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).
Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.

---

### Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set

- **Severity:** Low
- **URL:** `https://stg-app.bosta.co/api/v2/pickups`
- **Description:** HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL). HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.
- **Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to enforce Strict-Transport-Security.

---

### Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field(s)

- **Severity:** Low
- **URL:** `https://stg-app.bosta.co/api/v2/pickups`
- **Description:** The web/application server is leaking information via one or more "X-Powered-By" HTTP response headers. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other frameworks/components your web application is reliant upon and the vulnerabilities such components may be subject to.
- **Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress "X-Powered-By" headers.
